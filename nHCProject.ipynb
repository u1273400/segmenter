    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The nHC project stands for nano-House-Controller project.  The idea of the nHC is a network of ioT devices around the house that ensures a connected smart house(CSH).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main features of this project include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Low power controllers that can be powered over months\n",
    "2. Collection of trivial parameters including motion sensing, temperature, humidity, ambiency etc.\n",
    "3. Miniature control of trivial parameters plus an digital/analog i/o controller/actuation extension.\n",
    "4. interconnectivity of the controllers to a central hub that will have internet connectivity.\n",
    "5. wireless connectivity of devices\n",
    "\n",
    "The system diagram for the nHC project is as follows:\n",

    "## Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup of the nHC project consists two major players.  The hub and the nano-controllers (ncs or minions). The overall goal of the minions is the most compact design having low power extended battery life.  In theory, the smaller the components are the less power they are to consume therefore, thankfully, both goals compliment each other and do not counteract each other.  On the other hand however, each of the constraints of power and minitaurisation requires a significant amount of engineering to achieve a production-satisfactory level of implementation.  The hub is the data aggregator, controller and communications hub.  Essentially the hub is the nHc system's link to the outside world offering both communications and control of the nHC system from the outside world.\n",
