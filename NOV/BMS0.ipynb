    "### Model Based Approach\n",
    "Batteries can be designed using empirical or model-based approaches.  In an empirical approach, cells are built and tested for performance.  Based on the results of the tests, the batteries are redesigned and tested again.  This is a time-consuming and expensive process. The cheaper option, is to used a model to predict performance baed on mathematical theory. This process is termed computer-aided engineering (CAE) because the battery can be designed and optimized relatively quickly and inexpensively on the computer.  Model-based design ensures the batteries developed have the best performance, making them competitive in the marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model-based approach builds upon fundamental physics-based model that predicts battery response.  The model starts with the electrochemical and physical partial differential equations (PDEs) that govern the flow of ions through a bettery cell.  The model requires physical constants (e.g. Faraday's constant) and parameters that may not be independently measurable and/or known (e.g. diffusion coefficients). Given a time-varying battery input parameters can be varied according to different battery designs and the performance predicted.  Thus, the battery can be optimized for maximal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "BMSs can also be designed using empirical or model-based approaches.  Almost all BMSs rely on battery models, but the sophistication varies considerably.  At the lowest level, hueristic models that roughly predict the observed performance are used.  More advanced empirical models that fit equivalent circuits to the meaured response over a specified frequency bandwidth models of the batteries.  These models are more difficult to derive and simplify for real-time battery.  The relationships between the respose and system parameters are known.  Fundamental model-based controllers have a built-in understanding of the underlying processes, allowing them to be more efficient, accurate, and safe.\n",

    "Figure 1.1 shows a schematic diagram of a battery cell.  It conists of positive and negative electrodes immersed in an electrolyte solution.  The electrodes can be solid material or porous to allow the electrolyte to infiltrate through.  The separator prevents electrons from flowing but allows positive and negative ions to migrate between the two electrodes through the electrolyte solution.  The positive and negative current collectors provide a pathway for electrons to flow through an external circuit.  During discharge, the negative electrode is the anode and the positive electrode is the cathode.  Positive ions move from the anode to the cathode through the electrolite separator.  Negative ions move in the opposite direction.  The anode builds up negative charge and the cathode builds up positive charge, creating the cell voltage V(t).  Negatively charged electrons flow through an external load from the anode to the cathode, creating a current in the opposite direction.  The sign convention for positive current is in the opposite direction of the electron flow.  During charge, the process is reversed and electrons are forced into the cathod (now the negative electrode).\n",

    "During charging, the negative electrode material dissolves inthe electrolyte solution to form a positive ion and the electron in what is called an oxidation reaction.  The positive electrode consumes electrons by depositing positive ions from the electrolyte in what is called a reduction reaction.  The reactions are reversible in secondary (or rechargeable) batteries so that discharging the battereies returns the electrodes to their pre-charged states. The ions move through the electrolyte under diffusion and migration.  Diffusion results from the existence of concentration gradient in the electrolyte.  Over time, if there is no ion production, the ions in the electrolyte diffuse evenly throughout the cell.  Migration results fromt he presence of the electric field generated by the positive and negative electrodes.  The positive ions migrate toward the negative electrode and negative ions migrate towards the positive electrode.  The movement of ions through the lectrolyte and electrons through the external circuit enable storage and release of energy. "

    "The power and energy capacity of Li-ion batteries fade with cycling.  Power fade is primarily due to an increase in internal resistance or impedance.  Internal resistance causes ohmic losses that waste energy, produce heat, and accelerate ageing.  In addition to ohmic energy losses, Li-ion batteries lose capacity over time due to degradation of the positive and negative electrodes and the electrolyte.  The degradation mechanisms are complex, coupled, and dependent on cell chemistry, design, and manufacturer.  In the negative electrode, the dominant ageing mechanisms are:\n",

    "The dynamic performance of a battery in charge and discharge operation regulates the speed at which current can be put into and taken from storage.  The terminal voltage does not remain constant during charge and discharge, but rises and false during steady charging and discharging respectively.  After charging or discharging has stopped, the transient voltage respose settles out in seconds to minutes.  For sufficiently long charge, the battery voltage saturates at a maximum value.  In these overcharge situations, most of the input energy goes to heating losses or side reactions that can be harmful to the battery.  Similarly, undercharge occurs when the battery voltage falls below the end or cut-off voltage dur to excessive discharge and can cause damage to the battery."

    "The working range of a battery is determined by the SOC, defined as the percentage maximum possible charge that is present inside a rechargable battery.  A fully charged battery is as 100% SOC. The working SoC range depends on the application.  HEVs with Ni-MH batteries, for example, typically operate from 30% to 70% SoC.  In this SoC range the battery has very high coulometric efficiency.  The DOD (DoD=100%-SOC) is another way to quantify stored charge.\n",

    "As the current rate is constant, one can plot the voltage respose versus time or DoD.  The low rate curve approximates the equilibrium cell (or open-circuit) potential.  The best open-circuit potential curve is flat over a broad range of DoD so that the voltage remains essentially constant during discharge, simplifying the design and reducing the cost of the associated voltage-regulation circuitry. The medium rate discharge cuve is shifted downward due to ohmic losses over the entire DoD range and charge transfer kinetic losses and mass transport limitations at low and high DoD, respectively.  The high rate discharge case demonstrates that the voltage drops so quickly so that only a fraction of the capacity can be utilized at high disrcharge rates."

    "Initially, when the battery has a low SoC, a CC charge is applied to bring the voltage up to the CV level.  If the CV charge is applied during this initial phase, the current will be too high and side reactions or excessive temperature rise will result.  Once the desired voltage level has been achieved, the charger switches to CV mode and the current decreases as the battery reaches 100% SoC.  Leaving the battery on CV mode for long periods of time is called a float charge.  Similarly, a tricke charge maintains CC mode at low (C/100) rate.  More sophisticated chargers use multiple CC and CV steps of different current and voltage levels, tapered current-time trajectories, and battery maximize life, safety and efficiency.  Fast charge controllers enable high current charging but use feedback to cut off the charging current before an excessive rise in gassing pressure, or temperature occurs."

In fast charge mode, Pb-acide batteries can be charged up to 4C.  Ni-MH batteries can be fast charged at as high as 1C with a controller that terminates charge when the voltage and/or temperature rates exceed thresholds. Li-ion batteries accept 2C as a high rate of charge, but excessively low and high cell voltages should be avoided."

    "Batteries perform poorly at extremely low and high temperatures.  At low temperature, ionic diffusion and migration can be hindered and damaging side reactions (e.g. lithium plating) can occur.  High temperatures favour other side reactions, such as corrosion and gas generation.  The discharge operating range of a battery typically has a lower lower limit and higher upper limit than the charge operating range.  For Pb-acid batteries, charge and discharge temperatures should be limited to an operating range of -40-60$^oC$. Li-ion batteries have an operating range of -20-60$^oC$. Ni-MH have the narrowest operating range of -20-45$^oC$."
