    "## Axioms of Probability\n",
    "In order to present axioms, there is a need to introduce the concept of $\\sigma-algebras$.  Let us consider the following probability space properties\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability Space properties\n",
    "Let $\\Omega$ be an abstract space, that is with no special structure.  Let $2^\\Omega$ denote all subsets of $\\Omega$, including the empty set denoted by 0.  With $\\mathcal{A}$ being a subset of $2^\\Omega$, we consider the following properties:\n",
    "1. $ 0 \\in \\mathcal{A}$ and $\\Omega \\in \\mathcal{A}$;\n",
    "2. If $A\\in\\mathcal{A}\\text{ then }A^c \\in \\mathcal{A},\\text{ where }A^c$ denotes the complement of A;\n",
    "3. $\\mathcal{A}$ is closed under finite unions and finite intersections: that is, if $A_1,\\dots,A_n$ are all in $\\mathcal{A}$ as well (for this it is enough that $\\mathcal{A}$ be stable by the union and the intersection of any two sets);\n",
    "4.  $\\mathcal{A}$ is closed under countable unions and intersections: that is, if $A_1, A_2, A_3, \\dots$ is a countable sequence of events in $\\mathcal{A}$, then $\\bigcup_{i=1}^\\infty A_i\\text{ and }\\bigcap_{i=1}^\\infty A_i$ are also in  $\\mathcal{A}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition 1 An Algebra\n",
    " $\\mathcal{A}$ is an algebra if it satisfied (1), (2) and (3) probability space properties above.  It is a $\\sigma-algebra$ if it satisfied (1), (2) and (4) probability space properties above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that under (2), (1) can be replieced by either (1):$0\\in \\mathcal{A}$ or by (2) $\\Omega \\in \\mathcal{A}$. Note also that (1)+(4) implies (3), hence $\\sigma-algebras$ are in essence algebras but not particularly the reverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition 2 $\\sigma$-Algebra\n",
    "If $\\mathcal{C}\\subset 2^\\Omega$, the $\\sigma-algebra$ generated by $\\mathcal{C}$, and written $\\sigma(\\mathcal{C})$, is the smallest $\\sigma-algebra$ containing  $\\mathcal{C}$.  (It always exists because $2^\\Omega$ is a $\\sigma-algebra$, and the intersection of a family of $\\sigma-algebras$ is again a $\\sigma-algebra$."

    "3. If $\\Omega=\\mathbb{R}$ (the Real numbers) (or more generally $\\Omega$ is a space with a topology, the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra is the $\\sigma$-algebra generated by the open sets (or by the closed sets, which is equivalent)."
