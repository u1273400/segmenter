    "\n",
    "*The ear shown, in figure 1 above includes the pinna which filters sound and focuses it into the external auditory canal.  Sound then acts upon the eardrum where it is transmitted and amplified by the three bones, the malleus, incus and stapes, to the oval window, opening on to the cochlea.  The figure shows the cochlea shaded in grey and drawn straight for clarity, whereas in reality it is somewhat coiled*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The cochlear, as a coiled tube, contains approximately 35 mm long semi-rigid pair of membranes (basilar and Reissner's) enclosed in a fluid called endolymph.  The basilar membrane carries the organs of Corti, each of which contains a number of hair cells arranged in two rows (approximately 3,500 inner and 20,000 outer hair cells)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Small electrical impulses are generated by the hair cells when tension is applied to them (usually when they are pulled, so that auditory response occurs during the rarefaction part of an oscillation in the fluid surrounding them).  The width and stiffness of the basilar membrane tapers along its length, and thus when a vibration is applied to the system, the location on the basilar membrane which resonates is dependent upon the frequency.  This process provides some frequency selectivity to the ear, with active processing by the auditory cortex providing thethe rest.  In fact the auditory cortex processing substantially improves frequency selectivity.  Nerves carry electrical impules from the ear into the brain where extensive uncounscious processing occurs.  The nature of the processing is not fully understood; however it is highly nonlinear, involves correlation between signals from each ear, and possibly with other senses (such as feel of vibrations, and sight).  The ear may seem to integrate over short times and also process more corssly repetitive patterns in different ways*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Active mechanims also operate in the air, which includes tensioning the muscles operating on the malleus and stapes, to protect the ear from loud sounds, reducing reducing the firing rate of certain hair cells and reportedly even producing sounds on occasions.  Further evidence for this is that audio acuity is reduced by illness or the taking of certain drugs, and earache can be caused by the failure of the inner ear muscles to protect the ear drums.*"
