    "### Linearisation Steps\n",
    "For non-linear systems we must linearize the system so we can find the transfer function.  The first step is to recognise the non-linear component and write the nonlinear differential equation.  Then we linearise a nonlinear equation, we linearize it for a very small signal inputs about a steady-state solution when the small-signal input is equal to zero.  This steady-state solution is called equilibrium and is selected as the second step in the linearisation process.  For example when a pendulum is at rest, it is at equilibrium.  The angular displacement is described by a non-linear differential equation, but it can be expressed with a linear differential equation for small excursions about this equilibrium point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we linearise the nonlinear differential equation, and then we take the Laplace transform of the linearised differential equation, assuming zero initial conditions.  Finally, we separate input and output variables and form the tranfer function.  Let us first see how to linearise a function; later, wewill apply the method to linearisation of a differential equation.\n",
