    "1. Equations of motion:  For simplicity we assume that the rotational inertia of the wheels is negligible and that there is frection retarding the motion of the car that is proportional to the car's speed with proportionality constant, b. In this simple model, a linear approximation is used. The car can then be approximated for modeling purposes using the free-body diagram seen in Figure 2 which defines coordinates, shows all forces acting on the body (heavy lines), and indicates the acceleration (dashed lines).\n",

    "Satellites as shown in Figure 3, usually require attitude control so that the antennas, sensors and solar panels are properly oriented. Antennas are usually pointed toward a partiular location on earth, while solar panels need to be oriented toward the sun for maximum power generation.  To gain insight into the full three-axis attitude control system, it is helpful to consider one axis at a time. Write the equations of motion for one axis of this system and show how they would be depicted in a block diagram.  In addition, determine the transfer function of this system and construct the system as if it were to be evaluated via MATLAB's SIMULINK.\n",

The control force comes from reaction jets that produce a moment of $F_cd$ aout the mass center.  There may also be small distrubance moment $M_D$ on the satellite, which arise primarily from solar pressure acting on any assymetry in the solar panels.
