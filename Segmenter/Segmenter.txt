 

Java Speech API (JSAPI)
-----------------------

The Java Speech API comprises speech engines. A speech engine can either be a
synthesiser or a recogniser.

### relevance to the grand scheme of things

The final speech segmenter and recogniser application will be implemented based
upon the java speech API and as such, JSAPI tool forms as a background to the
grand scheme of the overall implementation.

### Java speech markup language

This comprises production elements, structural elements and other miscellaneous
elements.

 

z-Transform
-----------

The z-transform is a constrained version of the Discrete Time Fourier
Transform(DTFT). If we compare the DTFT to the z-transform, equations (1) and
(2) below

$$
X(z)= \sum\limits_{n=\infty }^{\infty}{x[n]z^{-n}} 
$$

[@equation1]

 

$$
X(z)= sum_{n=-oo }^{oo}x[n]e^{-j\omegan} 
$$

[@equation2]

We find essentially that the z transform is the DTFT constrained to
$z=e^{j\omegan}$.

 

It can be shown that the z-operator is a linear operator and that the weighted
time-shifted timed function is transferable between the signal and it’s
transform, that is:

$$
sum_{n=-oo }^{oo}kx[n]e^{-j\omegan}=ksum_{n=-oo }^{oo}x[n]e^{-j\omegan} 
$$

 

### Region of Convergence

We also define a property of the z-transform called the Region of Convergence
which is the values of z for which there exists a z-transform.
