    "Demuynck, K., & Laureys (2002) use 2 algorithms to compare manual speech segmentation to automatic speech segmentation.  Both algorithms requires the use of Hidden Markov Models.  The strength of these methods is also a  weakness.  It uses dependent probability to more accurately determine the predicted value based on trained data.  The more dependencies the more accurate the prediction will be within the limit of accuracy.\n",
