Formants are counted from the lowest frequency upwards, and usually only the first three (F1, F2 and F3) contribute significantly to the intelligibility of speech.  Some fricative sounds like /ch/ can produce lots of formants but generally speaking F1 contains most of the speeche energy while F2 and F3 contribute more to speech intelligibility*.\n",

It is however, a very different matter in a tonal language such as Mandarin Chinese which is totally dependent on tone for conveying meaning.

    "*The previous procedure has the role of smoothing the spectrum, performing processing that is similar to that executed by the human ear.  The next step consists of computing the logarithm of the square magnitude of the coefficients $Y_t(m)$ obtained from equation (16).  This reduces to simply computing the logarithm of the magnitude of the coefficients, because the logarithm algebraic property which brings back the logarithm of a power to a multiplication by a scaling factor.  Relevant benefits of this procedure can be seen by resorting to the frame work of cepstral analysis introduced in a subsequent section.  Here we note that magnitude and logarithm processing is performed by the ear as well.  Moreover, magnitude disgards the useless phase information while a logarithm performs a dynamic compression, making feature extraction less sensitive to variation in dynamics.*"
